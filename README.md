## Introduction
The LibraryManager is a simple API designed as a learning project to better understand the principles of clean architecture and to start using Entity Framework. This project was developed using .NET 8, Entity Framework, and follows the Repository Pattern within a Clean Architecture design. It utilizes SQL Server as its database backend.

## Purpose
This project serves as a hands-on way to explore Clean Architecture and the functionalities of Entity Framework. It is not a complete solution and lacks certain features such as input validation and advanced error handling, which would be expected in a production environment. The main goal was to implement a basic API for managing users, books, and loans in a library system.

## Features
- **Users**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete users.
- **Books**: Add, update, delete, and fetch book details.
- **Loans**: Manage the lending and return of books.
